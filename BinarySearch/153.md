# LeetCode 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## 難度

Medium

## 題目

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

## 解法
```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var findMin = function(nums) {
    return bs(nums, 0, nums.length - 1)
};

var bs = (nums, left, right) => {
    if (left + 1 >= right) return Math.min(nums[left], nums[right]); //Only 1 or 2 elements
    if (nums[left] < nums[right]) return nums[left]; // Sorted
    var mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    return Math.min(bs(nums, left, mid - 1), bs(nums, mid, right))
}
```

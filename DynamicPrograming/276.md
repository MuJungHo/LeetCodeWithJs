# LeetCode 276. Paint Fence

## 難度

Easy

## 題目

There is a fence with ```n``` posts, each post can be painted with one of the ```k``` colors.

You have to paint all the posts such that no more than two _adjacent_ fence posts have the same color.

Return the ```total number of ways``` you can paint the fence.

## 翻譯

n 根柱子，k 種顏色，且最多只能相鄰兩根柱子為相同顏色，算出共有幾種顏色組合。

## 思路

k = 3

**n = 1**
r = k = 3。

**n = 2**
same = k
diff = k * (k - 1)
result = 3 + 6

**n = 3**
same = k * (k - 1) // 相同顏色數為上一輪不同顏色數
diff = (k * (k - 1) + k) * (k - 1) // 不同顏色數為上一輪總和 * (k - 1)
result = 6 + 18

**n = 4**
same = 18
diff = 48
result = 66


## 解法
```
if (n === 0) return 0
if (n === 1) return k

var same = 0 // 進入迴圈前 n = 1
var diff = k
var result = same + diff

for (let i = 2; i <= n; i ++) {
  same = diff
  diff = result * (k - 1)
  result = same + diff
}
return result
```

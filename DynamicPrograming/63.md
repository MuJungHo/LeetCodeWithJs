# LeetCode 63. Unique Paths II

## 難度

Medium

## 題目

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a ```m x n``` grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and space is marked as ```1``` and ```0``` respectively in the grid.

## 思路

狀態轉移方程： dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]

## 解法

```
/**
 * @param {number[][]} obstacleGrid
 * @return {number}
 */
var uniquePathsWithObstacles = function(obstacleGrid) {
    let m = obstacleGrid.length
    let n = obstacleGrid[0].length
    let dp = new Array(m).fill(0).map(() => new Array(n).fill(0));
    dp[0][0] = obstacleGrid[0][0] == 0 ? 1 : 0
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0) {
                let up = i > 0 && obstacleGrid[i - 1][j] === 0 ? dp[i - 1][j] : 0; // 非最上排且不為無障礙物
                let left = j > 0 && obstacleGrid[i][j - 1] === 0 ? dp[i][j - 1] : 0;
                dp[i][j] += +up + left;
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[m-1][n-1]
};
```
